 CREATURE CODEX

 WEIRDING SCROLL

 A humanoid figure teeters, clutching both ends of a curious scroll. The curled eldritch parchment is marked with strange, alien glyphs on one side that pulsate with an arcane glow, illuminating the figure's twisted face. Tendrils of opalescent light snake out from the surface of the bizarre scroll as the ensorcelled figure staggers forward.

 ARCANE GUARDIANS. A weirding scroll is a grim construct crafted from a length of magically-treated humanoid skin. This morbid parchment is prepared by a master surgeon before undergoing certain profane and secret rites that imbue the scroll with formidable mind-warping abilities. This surreptitious construct lies in wait for a living creature to come along and serve as an unwilling surrogate for its creator's commands.

 NIMBUSED PUPPETEERS. The mobility of this odd artifice is limited. When a weirding scroll isn't flitting on the wind in a form of mock lifelessness, it employs a powerful domination, which manifests as an eerie tangle of light that entwines its victim.

 ATHENAEUM WARDENS. The first weirding scrolls were

 constructed to help protect the massive libraries of an ancient race of sorcerer kings. Since then, the riddle of their creation has fallen into the hands of only the most studious of artificers. CONSTRUCT NATURE. A weirding scroll doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

 ACTIONS

 Dominate. A weirding scroll beguiles one humanoid that it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 hour. The charmed creature obeys the telepathic commands of the weirding scroll to the best of its ability. This action works like the dominate person spell, except the weirding scroll doesn't need to concentrate to maintain the domination, and it can't take total and precise control of the target. The weirding scroll can have only one humanoid under its control at one time. If it dominates another, the effect on the previous target ends.

 False Appearance. While the weirding scroll remains motionless it is indistinguishable from a normal scroll

 Tendril of Light. Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target. Hit 3 (106) psychic damage plus 3 (106) radiant damage.
